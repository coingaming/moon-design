## When does a component go in the design system?

[Does It Belong in the System?](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/i-made-this-does-it-go-in-the-system-3b67b9894531)



## Release Process

Thanks to [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets), we can generate version bumps automatically.

1. Ensure that `develop` branch is up to date with `master`. 
2. Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository and follow CLI instructions to generate a new changeset.
3. Run `pnpm changeset version` command. This will bump the versions of the packages previously specified with pnpm changeset (and any dependents of those) and update the changelog files.
4. Run `pnpm install`. This will update the lockfile and rebuild packages.
5. Commit the changes. (e.g `git add .` and `git commit -m "chore: bump version X.X.X"`)
5. Push your changes.
6. Raise a pull request from [`develop` into `master`](https://github.com/coingaming/moon-design/compare/master...develop).
7. Obtain at least 1 approval.
8. Click the "Merge Pull Request" button to trigger an automatic release, monitoring progress in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/coingaming/moon-design).
9. Tag a version and push your tag (`git tag vX.X.X` and `git push && git push --tags`)
10. Communicate the release to the team!

## Prerelease Process 

You might want to release a version of your packages before you do an actual release, Changesets lets you do this but there are some caveats because of the complexity that monorepos add that are important to understand.

When you want to do a prerelease, you need to enter prerelease mode. You can do that with the pre enter <tag>. The tag that you need to pass is used in versions(e.g. 1.0.0-beta.0) and for the npm dist tag.

A prerelease workflow might look something like this:

```
pnpm changeset pre enter alpha
pnpm changeset
pnpm changeset version
pnpm install

git checkout -b "feat/prerelease"
git add .
git commit -m "Enter prerelease mode and version packages"

pnpm changeset publish
git push --follow-tags

pnpm changeset pre exit
```


## Icons

### Designing

Icons are exported from Figma and stored in the adjacent [`svg`](packages/assets/raw/svg) directory.

Each icon **must**:

- have it's own `32×32` artboard.
  - in other words, a `viewBox` that is **at least `32`** on one axis:
    - good: `viewBox="0 0 32 18"`, `viewBox="0 0 32 32"`.
    - bad: `viewbox="0 0 20 34"`.
- contain only one exportable layer, which has:
  1. a single path or group.
  1. a kebab-case layer name prefixed with `icon-`
     - this is essential for the [build step](#building).
  1. the export format defined as "SVG".
- have its color fill set to `#DE1E7E` (remember "DELETE") if you want the color to be modified.

Any changes to this Sketch file should be committed **as well as** the Sketch-generated SVGs. To export all SVGs in Sketch, select `File > Export` and in the next step choose the [`svg`](packages/assets/raw/svg) directory as the output location.

### Building

For performance benefits (such as code-splitting) we opted for creating individual React components for **each** icon, rather than one single component.

We make use of [SVGR](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/svgr/), to transform the above SVG icons in [`assets`](packages/assets/raw/svg) to React components in [`moon-icons`](packages/icons/README.mdx).

To update/add icons run: `yarn assets build`

- Runs SVGR based on the [config options](packages/icons/src/config/svgr.js).
- Builds React `.tsx` files for each component with the [template](packages/icons/src/config/template.js).

## Git Strategy

### Commits

Commits follow the [Angular Commit Message Format](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines). When committing changes, make use of the [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) CLI to generate consistent commit messages:

```
pnpn run commit
```

### Branches

#### Base Branch

As a developer, you will you be branching and merging from `develop`, our base branch.

Consider `origin/master` to always represent the latest code deployed to production.

#### Supporting Branches

Use supporting branches for all new **features** and **bug fixes**. Unlike the base branch, these branches have a limited life-time and should be removed after merging.

The different types of branches should be named as follows:

- **Feature**: `feature/feature-name`
- **Bug fix**: `fix/fix-name`

#### Workflow

1. Create the branch locally and then push to GitHub if it does not exist yet.

   A branch should always be 'publicly' available, and should never exist in just one developer's local repo.

1. Make a pull request.
1. Add the `in progress` tag until ready for review.
1. Periodically, keep changes up to date with develop via `git rebase develop`.
1. Grab a review and remove the `in progress` tag.
1. One approved, it's down to you to merge the branch into `develop`. Code can **only** be contributed to `develop` via using pull requests.
1. Delete your branch.

#### Rebasing develop branch to your branch example

1. `git checkout develop`
1. `git pull`
1. `git checkout your-branch`
1. `git rebase develop`

#### Feature Flags

Long-lived feature branches present problems when you need to build code on top of unfinished work. Merge unfinished features into the `develop` branch (following the steps [outline above](#workflow)) so others can build off their work, but keep them hidden from your users and testers behind feature flags. Enable the flag in development to use the feature without the changes affecting anyone else. Once the feature is finished, you can remove the flags or use them to roll out to selected users and testers.

## Code Standards

### Accessibility

All features should attempt to conform to as many items on The A11Y Project's [Web Accessibility Checklist](https://a11yproject.com/checklist) as possible. If a checkbox can't be completed, the justification should be documented for future reference.

As part of our TypeScript linting process, we make use of [`react-a11y` rules](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y) (surfaced via [`tslint-microsoft-contrib`](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib)) to catch any common issues. `react-a11y-role-has-required-aria-props` is currently disabled for [incorrect results](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib/issues/409).

### Mobile First

Mobile devices are the most commonly used methods of browsing the web.
When it comes to designing and developing your component, always build with mobile in mind first.

Need to modify the style at specific breakpoints? Scale your changes **upwards**; build for mobile by default and _then_ add media queries for changes on larger sizes.

Want to use CSS Grid? Set your component to `display: block;` by default to stack items on mobile and other unsupported devices, then implement your grid at larger breakpoints.

## Code Style

Code formatting is handled **automatically** via [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) on pre-commit. However, you could install an [IDE extension](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) or run manually via `yarn format <prettier-args>`.

Linting will catch any further non-formatting issues:

- [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)
  - **Config**: [tslint.json](.config/tslint/tslint.json)
  - **Note**: As TSLint does not yet support TypeScript project `references` [(palantir/tslint#4137)](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4137), TSLint must be executed via `lerna run` to treat each package correctly.

### Component Structure

#### Directory Structure

Before contributing new component in design system need to determine should it be put to core package or should be created new package for this component. For this you need follow the rule: if the components has complicated logic or some external dependencies - for it should be created new package.

Please stick to a directory style to make things visually easier to track new component: 
- the new component should be placed in separate folder and be given corresponding name (more details about the naming below);
- styled component shoud be placed in `styles` folder.  But only the ones used for this folder component. If any component down the tree needs styled stuff, they should have their own folder for it;
- all component's logic better to moove to the hook and create a folder or file with the hook name;
- all the nested components should be placed in folder `private`;
- from the main file should be exported outside, only one component and it's interface;

For a basic component, the directory structure would look something like this:

```
+————————————+
│   Badge    │
+————————————+


components
├── badge
│   ├── styles
│       ├── Container.ts
│   └── Badge.tsx
└── …
```

For larger components, consider breaking down into smaller partials:

```

components
├── singleSelect
│   ├── private
│       ├── styles
│           ├── SearchWrapper.ts
│       ├── Options.tsx
│       ├── SingleSelectWithContext.tsx
│   ├── styles
│       ├── Container.ts
│       ├── SelectLabel.ts
│   └── SingleSelect.tsx
└── …
```

!! Any styled components created should be .ts and not .tsx. The same goes for custom hooks, if you need to make them .tsx, it means they are not just styled components anymore.

!! All what was placed in `private` and `styled` folders exlude from export outside, baced on barrelsby config.

#### Naming

- **Components** should be defined in **PascalCase**.

  For example: `<ComponentName/>`

  - Component partials should be prefixed by the component name:

    For example: `<ComponentNameTitle/>`


#### Documentation

Each component feature must have a corresponding description page in `next-docs/pages/components` with code exepmples of all possible states.

- [`next-docs/pages/components`](next-docs/pages/components)



## ES Modules

---

### Rules

1. All your files should be named after the actual component. So the component `GroupIconCurrency` is inside the file `GroupIconCurrency.tsx`.
1. All your components should export a single default React component. This is only so we can enable tree shaking.
1. All first level subfolders inside `/src/` are considered public. People will use `import { } from @heathmont/moon-package-name/folder` to import files from those folders directly.
1. You are required to auto-generate an index file to for each subfolder which uses named exports to re-export all exports inside the folder + sub folders. This is required for tree shaking.
1. You are required to auto-generate an index file to for your package which uses named exports to re-export all exports. This is required to allow lerna to import the project proeprly.

### Build process

All packages are built in 2 separate formats, `commonjs` and `es`.

All code belongs in `/src` folder. When running yarn build, it will automatically generat a `lib` folder based on the code
inside `src`.

First we transpile `commonjs` format modules into the `lib` folder directly.
Second we transpile `es` format modules into the `lib/es` folder.
Third we generated typescript definitions into the `lib` folder directly.

### ES Release process

**Before** we release, we will:

1. Copy all files from `lib` folder into the root folder.
1. Update the `files`, `main`, `module` and `typings` fields in package.json

**After** we release, we will:

1. Remove all the files we copied over from `lib`.
1. Undo the changes to `files`, `main`, `module` and `typings` fields in package.json
