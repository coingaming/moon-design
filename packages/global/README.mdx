# Global

A tiny, crucial set of global styles to provide a solid and consistent foundation for our components; containing browser resets, `@font-face` defintions and page-level styling.

## Usage

The global `styles` should be included in the root of your application via [Emotion's
`Global` component](https://emotion.sh/docs/globals).

```jsx
/* App.tsx */
import * as React from 'react';
import { Global } from '@heathmont/sportsbet-global';

export const App = () => (
  <main>
    <Global styles={/* optional custom styles */} />
    {/* Your Appâ€¦ */}
  </main>
);
```

An additional `polyfill` is provided for further progressive enhancements such
as [`:focus-visible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible).

This should be included separately within your root application file/wrapper
component, as it only runs in the browser.
