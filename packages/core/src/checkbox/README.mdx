# Checkbox

Checkboxes offer users a 'yes' or 'no' choice. They can be used on their own,
or as a multiple choice fieldset.

## Usage:

```
import { Checkbox } from '@heathmont/moon-core';
```

```jsx react-live
<Checkbox label="I agree to receive bonus & marketing emails." />
```

```jsx react-live
<Stack>
  <Checkbox
    label={
      <React.Fragment>
        I confirm that I am at least 18 years of age, and accept the
        <Link href="#">Terms and Conditions</Link>.
      </React.Fragment>
    }
  />
</Stack>
```

## States

### Disabled

The Checkbox input can be disabled by passing the `disabled` prop.

```jsx react-live
<Checkbox disabled label="I agree to receive bonus & marketing emails." />
```

### Checked

The Checkbox input can be checked by passing the `checked` prop.

```jsx react-live
<Checkbox checked label="I agree to receive bonus & marketing emails." />
```

## Props

### Customize colours

You could use `color` prop to customize label.

Default colour is `trunks.100`:

```
color="trunks.100"

```

```jsx react-live
<Stack>
  <Checkbox label="Description of the checkbox's purpose." />
  <Checkbox label="Description of the checkbox's purpose." color="goten.100" />
  <Checkbox
    label="Description of the checkbox's purpose."
    color="piccolo.100"
  />
</Stack>
```

### aria-label

For use-cases where a label should be visually hidden, a descriptive `ariaLabel`
must be defined.

```jsx react-live
<Checkbox ariaLabel="Description of the checkbox's purpose." />
```

### ID

By default, `Checkbox` automatically generates a unique ID. This can be
overriden via `id`.

```jsx react-live
<Checkbox
  id="example-id"
  label="I agree to receive bonus & marketing emails."
/>
```
