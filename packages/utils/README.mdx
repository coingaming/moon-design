# Utils

Nifty mixins and tools for common design patterns.

```js
import { mq } from "@heathmont/sportsbet-utils";
```

## Media Queries

Returns a given pixel-based value (number) as an **upwards** direction media query in 'em'.

For example, `mq(500)` will return the following:

<Playground>
  {() => {
    return mq(500);
  }}
</Playground>

### Usage

With our breakpoint tokens, we can start to build-up our responsive styles:

```jsx
import styled from "@emotion/styled";
import { breakpoints } from "@heathmont/sportsbet-tokens";
import { mq } from "@heathmont/sportsbet-utils";

/* Changes border from `red` to `blue` from 'small' breakpoint upwards */

const Box = styled("div")`
  border: 1px solid red;

  ${mq(breakpoints.small)} {
    border-color: blue;
  }
`;
```
