# REM

An extension of [polished's `rem` function](https://polished.js.org/docs/#rem),
returning a given string or number value as a `rem` unit based on **our
[`base.fontSize` token](/themes/tokens#base)**.

For example `rem(14)` or `rem('14px')` will return the following:

```jsx react-live
<p>{rem(14)}</p>
```
