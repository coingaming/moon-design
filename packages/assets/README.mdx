# CDN

A collection of static assets for use across the Sportsbet.io estate, for now just hosting fonts.

Files in `static` are deployed to the `cdnUrl`, with `src` handling asset-specific config and styles.

## Usage

Before referencing assets in your project, you'll want to make sure you `preconnect` and `dns-prefetch` to the CDN for optimimum performance.

In a static HTML template, this would look something like:

```js
import { cdnUrl } from '@heathmont/sportsbet-design';

const template = ({ html }) => `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="preconnect" href="${cdnUrl}" crossorgin />
    <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="${cdnUrl}" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      ${html}
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
`;
```
