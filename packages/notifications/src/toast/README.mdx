# Toast

Short, time-based messages that slide in and out of a page.

## Usage:

```
import { Toast } from '@heathmont/moon-notifications';
```

#### Usage

Toast is used to give user feedback on the action or communicate changes in the system.

#### Interaction

Disappear automatically or can be dismissed by user.

#### Frequency

**Only one** Toast may be displayed at a time.

## Actions

A Toast can contain a single action. Because they disappear automatically, the action **shouldn’t** be “Dismiss” or “Cancel.

**Use design system `Link`** component for actions.

```jsx react-live
<Toast
  message={
    <p>This item already have the label "Sport". You could add a new label.</p>
  }
  position="inline"
  action={<Link href="#">Add</Link>}
  isCloseable={true}
/>
```

## variant

Toast can't have both Icon and Action at the same time.

#### Error

```jsx react-live
<Toast
  position="inline"
  variant="error"
  message={<p>Error message or notification</p>}
/>
```

#### Warning

```jsx react-live
<Toast
  position="inline"
  variant="warning"
  message={<p>Error message or notification</p>}
/>
```

#### Info

```jsx react-live
<Toast
  position="inline"
  variant="info"
  message={<p>Error message or notification</p>}
/>
```

#### Success

```jsx react-live
<Toast
  position="inline"
  variant="success"
  message={<p>Error message or notification</p>}
/>
```

## Appearing and disappearing

Snackbars appear without warning, and don't require user interaction.

Use `useSnackbar` hook if you want the Toast to automatically disappear from the screen after a minimum of 5 seconds, and a maximum of 10 seconds.
By default it's a 5 seconds.

`timeout={5000}`

```jsx react-live
() => {
  const [Toast, display] = useToast({
    message: <p>Appearing and disappearing works!</p>,
    timeout: 14000,
    variant: 'success',
    position: 'top',
    isCloseable: true,
    action: 'ADD',
  });

  return (
    <>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={display}>
        Show Toast
      </Button>
      {Toast}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Placement

At the bottom of the UI
Snackbars should be placed at the bottom of a UI, in front of app content.
Avoid placing a Toast in front of frequently used touch targets or navigation.

By default it has fixed position with same z-index as Dialog.

If you want to disable isFixed

`position="bottom" | "top"`

```jsx react-live
<Toast
  position="bottom"
  variant="success"
  message={<p>Deposit was successfull.</p>}
/>
```

```jsx react-live
<Toast variant="success" message={<p>Deposit was successfull.</p>} />
```
