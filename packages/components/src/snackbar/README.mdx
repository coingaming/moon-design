#### Usage

Snackbar is used to give user feedback on the action or communicate changes in the system.

#### Interaction

Disappear automatically or can be dismissed by user.

#### Frequency

**Only one** snackbar may be displayed at a time.

## Actions

A snackbar can contain a single action. Because they disappear automatically, the action **shouldn’t** be “Dismiss” or “Cancel.

**Use design system `Link`** component for actions.

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  message={
    <p>This item already have the label "Sport". You could add a new label.</p>
  }
  position="inline"
  action={<Link href="#">Add</Link>}
/>
```

## Status

Snackbar can't have both Icon and Action at the same time.

#### Error

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  position="inline"
  status="error"
  message={<p>Error message or notification</p>}
/>
```

#### Warning

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  position="inline"
  status="warning"
  message={<p>Error message or notification</p>}
/>
```

#### Info

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  position="inline"
  status="info"
  message={<p>Error message or notification</p>}
/>
```

#### Success

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  position="inline"
  status="success"
  message={<p>Error message or notification</p>}
/>
```

## Appearing and disappearing

Snackbars appear without warning, and don't require user interaction.

Use `useSnackbar` hook if you want the Snackbar to automatically disappear from the screen after a minimum of 5 seconds, and a maximum of 10 seconds.
By default it's a 5 seconds.

`timeout={5000}`

```jsx react-live
() => {
  const [Snackbar, displaySnackbar] = useSnackbar({
    message: <p>Appearing and disappearing works!</p>,
    timeout: 2000,
    status: 'success',
    position: 'top',
  });

  return (
    <>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={displaySnackbar}>
        Show snackbar
      </Button>
      {Snackbar}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Placement

At the bottom of the UI
Snackbars should be placed at the bottom of a UI, in front of app content.
Avoid placing a snackbar in front of frequently used touch targets or navigation.

By default it has fixed position with same z-index as Dialog.

If you want to disable isFixed

`position="bottom" | "top"`

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  position="bottom"
  status="success"
  message={<p>Deposit was successfull.</p>}
/>
```

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar status="success" message={<p>Deposit was successfull.</p>} />
```
