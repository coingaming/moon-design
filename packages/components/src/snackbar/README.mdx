# Snackbar

Snackbars provide brief messages about app processes at the bottom of the screen.

#### Usage

Snackbars inform users of a process that an app has performed or will perform. They appear temporarily, towards the bottom of the screen. They shouldn’t interrupt the user experience, and they don’t require user input to disappear.

#### Frequency

**Only one** snackbar may be displayed at a time.

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  isFixed={false}
  message={
    <p>This item already have the label "Sport". You could add a new label.</p>
  }
/>
```

## Actions

A snackbar can contain a single action. Because they disappear automatically, the action **shouldn’t** be “Dismiss” or “Cancel.

**Use design system `Link`** component for actions.

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  isFixed={false}
  message={
    <p>This item already have the label "Sport". You could add a new label.</p>
  }
  action={<Link href="#">Add</Link>}
/>
```

## Appearing and disappearing

Snackbars appear without warning, and don't require user interaction.

Use `autoHideDuration` if you want the Snackbar to automatically disappear from the screen after a minimum of four seconds, and a maximum of ten seconds.

`autoHideDuration={6000}`

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  isFixed={false}
  autoHideDuration={6000}
  message={
    <p>This item already have the label "Sport". You could add a new label.</p>
  }
  action={<Link href="#">Add</Link>}
/>
```

Use `isOpen` if you want to manually control appearing and disappearing.

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  isOpen={false}
  isFixed={false}
  message={
    <p>This item already have the label "Sport". You could add a new label.</p>
  }
  action={<Link href="#">Add</Link>}
/>
```

Use `onDismiss` if you want to manually control appearing and disappearing.

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  onDismiss={() => {
    console.log('Snackbar was dismissed.');
  }}
  autoHideDuration={6000}
  isFixed={false}
  message={
    <p>This item already have the label "Sport". You could add a new label.</p>
  }
  action={<Link href="#">Add</Link>}
/>
```

## Placement

At the bottom of the UI
Snackbars should be placed at the bottom of a UI, in front of app content.
Avoid placing a snackbar in front of frequently used touch targets or navigation.

By default it has fixed position with same z-index as Dialog.

If you want to disable isFixed

```jsx react-live
<Snackbar
  message={
    <p>This item already have the label "Sport". You could add a new label.</p>
  }
  action={<Link href="#">Add</Link>}
/>
```
