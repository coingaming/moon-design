# Logo

Logos help to reinforce the brand identity. By default, they fill all available
space. Sizing can be adjusted in the same manner as traditional SVGs; with
`width` and `height` props.

## Sportsbet

In it's default style…

```jsx react-live
<LogoSportsbet />
```

…and with adjusted style.

```jsx react-live
<LogoSportsbet height={spacing('large')} width="auto" />
```
