# Checkbox

Checkboxes offer users a 'yes' or 'no' choice. They can be used on their own,
or as a multiple choice fieldset.

```jsx react-live
<Checkbox label="I have read the Terms and Conditions" />
```

## States

### Disabled

The Checkbox input can be disabled by passing the `disabled` prop.

```jsx react-live
<Checkbox disabled label="I have read the Terms and Conditions" />
```

## Props

<PropsTable of={Checkbox} />
