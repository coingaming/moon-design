# File Input

Enabling users to upload one or more files inside a form.

A `label` offers additional context to the files required.

```jsx react-live
<Form>
  <FormItem>
    <FileInput id="fileInput1" label="Upload your ID" />
  </FormItem>
</Form>
```

## Placeholder

By default, File Input renders with "Choose file…", but this can be customised
via the `placeholder` prop.

```jsx react-live
<FileInput
  id="fileInput2"
  label="Upload your ID"
  placeholder="Choose a photo…"
/>
```

## Label

Although an additional `label` is encouraged, it won't display when
undefined.

```jsx react-live
<FileInput id="fileInput3" />
```

## States

### Error

Although an additional `placeholder` is encouraged, it won't display when
undefined.

```jsx react-live
<FileInput id="fileInput4" error />
```

## Props

<PropsTable of={FileInput} />
