# Progress Indicator

[JIRA link](https://coingaming.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CDS/pages/2033778811/Progress+indicator)

A progress indicator is a visual representation of a userâ€™s progress through a set of steps, guiding toward the completion of a specified process.

## Usage

Use this when the process has a known duration

Circular progress indicators display progress by animating an indicator along an invisible circular track in a clockwise direction.

```jsx react-live
<ProgressIndicator progress={30} fontSize="5rem" />
```
