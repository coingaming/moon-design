# Dialog Overlay

A small pop-up window to display additional content or request action from the
user.

```jsx react-live
() => {
  const [showDialog, setShowDialog] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => setShowDialog(true)}>
        Open Dialog
      </Button>
      <DialogOverlay
        isOpen={showDialog}
        onDismiss={() => setShowDialog(false)}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

## State

Dialog is a styled extension of Reach UI's "Dialog" component, with state
handled via `isOpen` and `onDismiss`. More information on these props, can be
found in the [Reach UI documentation](https://ui.reach.tech/dialog).

Examples on this page show usage with
[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), but this could also be
handled via higher-order components or libaries such as
[Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose).
