# Icons

Icons offer visual aids for common actions and tasks.

To aid with performance, Icons are surfaced as individual [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) components. Each icon component is prefixed with `Icon`.

```jsx react-live
<IconChevronDown />
<IconChevronLeft />
<IconChevronRight />
<IconChevronUp />
<IconChevronUpDown />
```

```jsx react-live
<IconClose />
<IconSettings />
<IconLeftArrowCurveRight />
```

```jsx react-live
<IconArrowTop />
<IconArrowRight />
<IconArrowBottom />
<IconArrowLeft />
```

## Customizing

### Color

Icon colors can be modified by adding the `color` attribute/CSS property to the component or its parent element.

```jsx react-live
<IconSettings color={colors.brand} />
```

### Size

Icon size can be modified by adding the `fontSize` attribute or `font-size` CSS property to the component or its parent element.

```jsx react-live
<IconSettings fontSize="40px" />
```
