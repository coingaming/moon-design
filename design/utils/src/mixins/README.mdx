# Mixins

## Breakout

```js
import { breakout } from '@heathmont/sportsbet-utils';
```

Quickly jump out of any parent's constraining `maxWidth` by applying the `breakout` mixin.

```jsx react-live
<div css={{ ...container(), background: colors.brand }}>
  <p>Bound by the Sportsbet container</p>
  <div css={{ ...breakout, background: colors.error }}>
    <p>Breakout from the parent container</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Disabled

```js
import { disabled } from '@heathmont/sportsbet-utils';
```

Apply common disabled styles to UI elements such as buttons and forms.

`disabled()` will also accept any CSS (as an object) and return it inside disabled selectors.

```jsx react-live
<button disabled css={{...disabled()}}>Submit</button>
<button disabled css={{...disabled({color: 'white'})}}>Submit</button>
```
