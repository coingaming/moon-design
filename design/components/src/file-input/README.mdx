# File Input

Enabling users to upload one or more files inside a form.

A `placeholder` offers additional context to the files required.

```jsx react-live
<Form>
  <FormItem>
    <FileInput placeholder="ID, passport, etc." />
  </FormItem>
</Form>
```

## Label

By default, File Input renders with "Choose file", but this can be customised
via the `label` prop.

```jsx react-live
<FileInput label="Upload photo" placeholder="ID, passport, etc." />
```

### Placeholder

Although an additional `placeholder` is encouraged, it won't display when
undefined.

```jsx react-live
<FileInput />
```

## States

### Error

Although an additional `placeholder` is encouraged, it won't display when
undefined.

```jsx react-live
<FileInput error />
```

## Props

<PropsTable of={FileInput} />
