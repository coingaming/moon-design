## Architecture

Our [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation) monorepo publishes key layers as individual `@heathmont/moon-` packages:

1. [`next-docs/`](#docs) - style guide and documentation
2. [`workspaces/`](#design-system) - Moon Design System
2. [`packages/`](#design-system) - Legacy components, solely for supporting older projects.


Packages are developed inside their respective `src` folders, utilizing [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) for dependency linking/sharing. The distributable code is generated in each package's lib by the TypeScript compiler.
