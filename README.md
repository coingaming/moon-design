## Architecture

Our [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation) monorepo publishes key layers as individual `@heathmont/moon-` packages:

1. [`next-docs/`](#docs) - style guide and documentation
2. [`packages/`](#design-system) - Moon Design System

`packages/`

1. [**Themes**](packages/themes/README.mdx) - theming feature
2. [**Utils**](packages/utils/README.md) - suite of tools to quickly access common token values.
3. [**Icons**](packages/components/README.mdx) - React components for each icon.
4. [**Core**](packages/components/README.md) - the individual building blocks of our UI.

Packages are developed inside their respective `src` folders, utilising [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) for dependency linking/sharing. Distributable code is generated in each package's `lib` by the typeScript compiler.

### Docs

`next-docs/`

Our project's style guide and documentation is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) inside its own individual package directory.
